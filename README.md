# JavaScript-Tutorials
These are the projects that I followed along to help build my foundation in JavaScript

Color - Flipper :

A Basic JavaScript project that has a index and a hex page. The index and hex pages both have similar functionalitys, once you click on a button, the background color of the webpage changes and displays the name of the color. For the index it will just be a random color from the rainbow. For the hex it would show a random color and it's hex value.

Multiple Counters:

An object oriented programming application that has two different counters with the same functionality of a regular counter. 

Lorem Ipsum:

An alternative dummy text to lorem ipsum. We take in user input and can generate up to 9 paragraphs of dummy texts. If the user doesn't include a value in range we generate just one paragraph.
